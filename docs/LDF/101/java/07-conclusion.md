In this workshop, we have seen how QL represents a program as a queryable AST that can be effectively used for reasoning about various program elements in relation to others as well as identifying them, and using only those to identify a vulnerable function.

We have also learned how to express conditions in a reusable manner by leveraging the object-oriented type system of QL, through refactoring our code into predicates and classes.
