## Overview

The Language Dependent Features Workshops are a new set of workshops designed to
provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the language-specific
aspects of CodeQL. The workshops cover fundamental concepts such as data-flow
analysis, taint tracking, and syntax analysis. These language-dependent aspects
of CodeQL are essential for understanding how to effectively write code queries
that are tailored to specific programming languages. For instance, taint
tracking is used to identify data that has been modified by an untrusted source
in web applications. Participants will learn how to use taint tracking to
improve the security of web applications written in languages such as PHP,
JavaScript, and Python.

The Language Dependent Features Workshops provide participants with a thorough
understanding of the extensions of CodeQL in the form of a standard library
written in the QL language. The standard library provides a set of predefined
predicates that can be used to query and analyze code in a specific language.
For example, in C++, the standard library provides predicates to analyze virtual
functions, class inheritance, and exception handling. In Java, the standard
library provides predicates to analyze reflection, inner classes, and anonymous
classes. By mastering the standard library of a specific language, participants
will be able to write more sophisticated queries that leverage the
language-specific features of CodeQL.

Overall, The Language Dependent Features Workshops are an excellent resource for
developers looking to gain a comprehensive understanding of CodeQL. By mastering
language-dependent aspects such as data-flow analysis, taint tracking, and
syntax analysis, participants will be able to write more sophisticated queries
that can identify complex security vulnerabilities and improve code quality.
Furthermore, the workshops provide participants with the knowledge needed to
effectively use the extensions of CodeQL provided by the standard library,
enabling them to write more powerful queries that can analyze the intricacies of
specific programming languages.
