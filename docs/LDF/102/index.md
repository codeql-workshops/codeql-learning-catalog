## Workshop Description

In the LDF-101 series of workshops we learned about how to reason about the syntax of a program. In LDF-101, you used the literal text of the program and used CodeQL to look for relevant items from a security-focused context.

"LDF-102 - Reasoning about Control Flow I" is a comprehensive workshop designed to introduce and deepen your understanding of using CodeQL to reason about control flow in your code. CodeQL, a powerful semantic code analysis engine, allows you to explore your codebase in a way that goes beyond syntax-based analysis. This workshop will guide you through the process of using CodeQL to identify and understand the control flow paths in your code, which is crucial for detecting potential vulnerabilities and bugs.

Contrasting this with syntax-based analysis, CodeQL offers a more profound and insightful analysis. While syntax-based analysis focuses on the structure of the code, CodeQL delves deeper into the semantics of the code, providing a more accurate and detailed understanding of the code's behavior. This difference makes CodeQL a more powerful tool for code analysis, as it can identify complex code patterns and potential issues that might be missed by a syntax-based analysis.

In this workshop, you will learn how to use CodeQL to analyze control flow in a variety of contexts. You will gain insights into how control flow can affect the behavior of your code, and how to use this knowledge to improve your code quality. You will also learn how to write your own CodeQL queries to explore and reason about the control flow in your codebase. This knowledge will empower you to identify and fix potential issues in your code, leading to more robust and secure software.
