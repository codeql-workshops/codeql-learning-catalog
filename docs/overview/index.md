## Welcome to the CodeQL Learning Catalog

The CodeQL Learning Catalog is a learning resource that has been designed to
deliver interactive CodeQL workshops. In addition to the content in this
website, each of the courses within the catalog exists as a directory within the
repository that serves this site.

To access the source of this site, please visit:
[workshops/codeql-learning-catalog](https://github.com/codeql-workshops/codeql-learning-catalog),
which contains the source of this website as well as the source of each workshop
contained inside.

## How Content is Structured

The content of the catalog is organized by both subject area and difficulty. Our
system for categorizing CodeQL workshops can be broken down into 4 main content
areas:

* **CodeQL Core (QLC)** - Fundamental, language-agnostic features
* **Language Dependent Features (LDF)** - Various features for which dedicated
  language-specific workshops must be constructed.
* **CodeQL Tooling, Infrastructure, and Practice (TIP)** - Topics related to the
  usage of CodeQL tooling from the perspective of a query author, for example,
  dedicated instruction on query performance optimization.
* **CodeQL Exploration and Projects (EXP)** - Interactive workshops and projects
  in CodeQL typically focused on a single language which may address issues like
  finding a relevant CVE or capture the flag exercise.
