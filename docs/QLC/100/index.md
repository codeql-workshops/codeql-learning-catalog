## Introduction

The QL Quickstart workshop is designed to provide participants with a
comprehensive introduction to the QL language used in CodeQL, with a focus on
the basics of setting up a development environment and writing QL queries. The
workshop covers several key topics, including setting up your development
environment for CodeQL development, preparing to write your first QL query,
writing your first QL query, the structure of a QL query, and the essence of a
QL query.

During the first section of the workshop, participants will learn how to set up
their development environment for CodeQL development. They will learn how to
download and install CodeQL tools and set up their environment to work with the
CodeQL query language. They will also learn about the basics of using CodeQL in
the context of a development environment, including how to navigate the
interface and run queries.

In the second section, participants will learn about the basics of preparing to
write their first QL query. They will learn about the different types of queries
that can be used in CodeQL, including database queries, code queries, and result
set queries. They will also learn about the structure of a QL query and the
different components that make up a query.

In the third section, participants will learn how to write their first QL query.
They will learn about the essence of a QL query and how to structure their code
to achieve the desired results. They will also learn how to debug their code and
troubleshoot common errors that can arise when working with CodeQL. By the end
of the workshop, participants will have a solid foundation in the QL language
and will ready to study subsequent topics about the QL language.
