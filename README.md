The CodeQL Learning Catalog is a resource dedicated providing detailed CodeQL
learning resources. The Catalog contains workshops, recordings, and learning
paths for improving your knowledge and skill in using CodeQL.

# How to Use The Catalog

The CodeQL Learning Catalog can be used in two different ways: as a workshop
author and as a workshop participant. In either use case, you may launch a
codespace from this repository with the following configurations:

- `.devcontainer/authors/devcontainer.json` - The container targeted for
  authors. This contains additional tools for creating workshops. 
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - The container for workshop participants.
  This contains the components needed to execute the workshop examples. 

The finished workshops may be found on the web at:
